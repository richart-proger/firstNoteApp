**Implement the Notes app**

The application has the following functions
1) adding a note
2) deleting a note
3) editing a note
4) view the list of notes with filtering by date or hash tag.
5) search for notes by substring according to the "contains" principle (the search should search by the text and by the name of the note)

The user has the ability to create an arbitrary number of notes.
The created notes should be available after restarting the application (i.e. saved in some permanent storage).

Note Parameters

Required:
- the text of the note
- date of creation

Optional:
- list of hash tags
- name

The application is console-based. To build the application, use Maven.
